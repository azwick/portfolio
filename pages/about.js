                        <p>I have been working as a designer for over 8 years. Since last year I decided to take a new step in my life and continue my education as a frontend developer. I am curious where my path will lead me and what projects I'll be working on in the future.</p>
                        <p>I donâ€™t want to live a normal and boring existence. So I try to remember myself every single day to live the life that I want to. But next to my desire to always reinvent myself, I'm a normal dude trying to leave my footprints in this world...</p>
